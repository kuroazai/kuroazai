<h1 align="center">Hi 👋</h1>

Software engineer and quantitative trader. I build the full stack of systematic trading infrastructure, from feature engineering and ML model development all the way through to live execution.

💻 Engineering & Quant Development
Python is my weapon of choice. I build production-grade trading engines, agentic AI systems, and automated pipelines. I sit at the intersection of software engineering and applied machine learning.

📈 4+ Years Live Trading
Profitable and self-funded, managing my own capital across FX, indices, and commodities through OANDA. I build ML models, deploy them, test them, break them, refine them, and let them trade real money. EURUSD, US30, GER30 are my bread and butter.

🤖 Systems & Automation
I design agentic systems that automate the full strategy lifecycle. Discovery, validation, execution, monitoring. If it can be systematized, I'll build it.

🚀 The Goal
I've always dreamt of running my own fund. Every system I build, every model I refine gets me one step closer. It's slowly coming together.

💡 Always Learning
Quantitative finance, machine learning, systems design. The edge is in never standing still.
